Integrate RightMessage into your website

== Description ==

RightMessage helps online businesses grow their list faster and generate more sales through survey funnels and personalized calls-to-action (CTAs).

This plugin makes it easier for those of us who use WordPress, by:

* automatically installing your RightMessage snippet into your WordPress site
* giving you segmentation options in your RightMessage account like "Current Post" and "Visitor's Favorite Category"
* giving you shortcodes for inserting embedded forms and trigger links for opening other kinds of forms
* automatically appending a personalized opt-in form at the bottom of all your blog posts, if you want

== Privacy ==
This plugin relies on the third-party service RightMessage to integrate personalized calls-to-action into your website. Data is sent to RightMessage when the plugin is activated and configured. For more information, please review [RightMessage's Privacy Policy](https://rightmessage.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://rightmessage.com/terms).
